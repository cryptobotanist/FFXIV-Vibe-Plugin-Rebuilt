## USB Dongle vs Lovense Dongle vs Other
We recommend you to use a bluetooth dongle. Here is the one we are using: [TP-Link Nano USB Dongle Bluetooth 5.0](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B09C25VRXD/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1642&creative=6746&creativeASIN=B09C25VRXD&linkCode=as2&tag=kaciexx-21&linkId=8b6c8c6e693ab549216c2dacad34e03b)

## Tested devices
- Microsoft XBox Controller
- Lovense (*please use bluetooth and not the lovense dongle*):
    Nora, Hush, Domi, Ferri, Diamo, Edge 2, Gush

## FAQ

### Troubleshooting
Make sure you have the [intiface-central](https://intiface.com/central/) and not the old Intiface Desktop.
1. Make sure your toy is not connected to another device (eg: your phone, your browser...). Disable the bluetooth on your phone.
2. Make sure the addon is correctly installed (check the installation process again).
3. Make sure you have the latest version.
4. Upgrade your Intiface by clicking and installing any updates (`Settings` tab).
5. Make sure the Intiface is up and running. Go to `Server status` > `Start Server`. You must have one green icon and one red icon on the top right side of the window.
6. Ingame, make sure the addon is connected to Intiface. Click on `connect` (in the `Connect` tab). Now, go back to Intiface. You should have 2 green icons on the top right side of the window.
7. Ingame, make sure the IP is either `127.0.0.1` or `0.0.0.0` or your real internal IP (eg: 192.168.1.250)
8. Ingame and on Intiface: make sure you are using the same `port` **on both sides**. You can try changing it to something
else **on both sides**.

### My device is not working correctly
Please make sure to test both Bluetooth and the dongle of the device. Choose the one that works best for you.

### My X-Box Controller is not working well
This is not related to this plugin. You probably should not use Bluetooth.

### My Lovense Nora is not doing rotations
Please stop using Lovense Dongle. Connect using the Lovense Connect or bluetooth. If you don't have bluetooth
please buy a bluetooth 5.0 dongle on amazon for 20$.

### The plugin does not connect to Intiface
Please make sure you are doing it right.
Make sure you have the [intiface-central](https://intiface.com/central/) and not the old Intiface Desktop.
1. Open Intiface and click on the top right side **red** icon.
2. Uncheck everything but not *WebSocket* and *Bluetooth*. WebSocket should have the following text: "on [All Interfaces]:12345"
3. Click on Start Server (now you should have one *green* icon and one *red* icon on the top right side).
4. Go to the plugin and click connect (you should have two *green* icons).
If this is not working: please try change the IP Address to 127.0.0.1 or your computer IP Address. Also make sure the port
is 12345 or correspond to the one in Intiface.

### The device disconnect every now and then.
Please make sure to follow those steps before asking for help:
1. Disable all triggers.
2. Create a new and very simple trigger (eg: vibration on a message). **Make sure it is correctly working**.
3. Wait twice the amount of time needed to have the issue again. (eg: if it was around 30min, then wait 60min or more).

If it works, then it's a trigger issue from one you have created. If not:
1. **Don't stop** the game, **don't stop** Intiface.
2. Turn **off and on** your controller device.
3. Let it reconnect to intiface (without restarting intiface app).
4. Test your trigger again.
If it works, then it probably a bluetooth issue. Nothing we can do about.

### How do I share my configuration
You can use the import and export feature. It will drop the configuration as a file in the desired folder.

### How does the priority system works ?
So regards, the priority system:
- **Trigger A** with priority 10 is triggered and played.
- **Trigger B** with priority 20 is being triggered => **Trigger** A is stop because B has a higher priority.
- **Trigger A** with priority 10 is retriggered => **Trigger A** is ignored because of lower priority, **Trigger B** continues to be played.

### How to stop a pattern
In this example, if you have a pattern that runs for 25 sec:
- Create a new trigger called "Stop Action"
- Define your trigger condition (Spell, chat, ...).
- Add the device(s) you want to stop.
- Set to Intensity and the value to zero for each motor you want to stop.

When the stop trigger is triggered, it will stop your pattern.

**NOTE**: if the priority is higher, it won't let you play your patterns again.
Unless the "Stop Action" trigger have a "stop after set".

### Is it possible to vibe at the level of the HP
As of today, it's not possible. However, you can create multiple triggers such
as:
- Trigger 1: HPChange 10-20%, Strength 20
- Trigger 2: HPChange 21-30%, Strength 30
- Trigger 3: HPChange 31-40%, Strength 40

### Gathering trigger
You can create gathering triggers. 
- Create a trigger using the type: Chat
    - Use the text: "You obtain a XXX" (replace XXX with the item)
    - Use the regex: "You obtain a î‚»(.+?)\."

Feel free to adapt it on your needs.

### Steam Deck users
If you are encountering network issues related to your plugins, you can set the
winver back to Windows 7 from XIVLauncher's Wine settings tab by clicking the
Wine Configuration box. This should fix your network and/or crash issue.
